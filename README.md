# piscreenrepo
A little repository for my raspberry pi project.

To-Do List:
  - Add pages in the launcher.py list thing
  - Make a calculator app
  - Change up the looks to make them closer to an actual GUI rather than text info:
    - Dice, Clock and Launcher need this. Stats is fine without.
  - Make a pixel art app?

Done:
  - Make a program launcher
  - Make a clock app
  - Make a dice app
  - Re-add the stats app
  - Make the scripts quit/stop when exited.
